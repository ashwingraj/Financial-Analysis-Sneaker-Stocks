In this repository you'll find the python notebook I used to pull in and analyze stock data for four publicly traded sneaker companies (Nike, Adidas, Under Armour, and Skechers). The notebook goes through data exploration of all stocks and then views in more detail the correlation and differences between Nike and Adidas. 


Below are the required python libraries

Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Cufflinks, Datetime, statsmodel
